## Exercise 4.6 Rewrite your pay computation with time-and-a-half for overtime
## and create a function called computepay which takes two parameters (hours and
## rate).
## Enter Hours: 45
## Enter Rate: 10
## Pay: 475.0

def computepay(h,r):
    if h <= 40:
        final = h * r
        return final
    elif h > 40:
        final = 40 * r + r * 1.5 * (h-40)
        return final

try:
    h = raw_input("Enter hours: ")
    hours = float(h)
    r = raw_input("Enter rate: ")
    rate = float(r)

except:
    print 'Error'
    quit()

pay = computepay(hours,rate)
print "Pay: ", pay

## Exercise 4.7 Rewrite the grade program from the previous chapter using a function
## called computegrade that takes a score as its parameter and returns a grade
## as a string.
## Score Grade
## > 0.9 A
## > 0.8 B
## > 0.7 C
## > 0.6 D
## <= 0.6 F

def computegrade(score):
    if score < 0:
        return "Bad score"
    elif score > 1.0:
        return "Bad score"
    elif 0.9 < score <= 1.0:
        return "A"
    elif 0.8 < score <= 0.9:
        return "B"
    elif 0.7 < score <= 0.8:
        return "C"
    elif 0.6 < score <= 0.7:
        return "D"
    elif score <= 0.6:
        return "F"

try:
    score = raw_input('Enter score: ')
    score = float(score)
    grade = computegrade(score)
    print grade
    
except:
    print 'Bad score'
