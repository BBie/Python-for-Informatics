## Exercise 4.6 Rewrite your pay computation with time-and-a-half for overtime
## and create a function called computepay which takes two parameters (hours and
## rate).
## Enter Hours: 45
## Enter Rate: 10
## Pay: 475.0

def computepay(hours,rate):
    if float(hours) <= 40:
        final = float(hours) * rate
        print "Enter Hours: ", float(hours)
        print "Enter Rate: ", float(rate)
        print "Pay: ", final
    elif float(hours) > 40:
        final = 40 * rate + rate * 1.5 * (float(hours)-40)
        print "Enter Hours: ", float(hours)
        print "Enter Rate: ", float(rate)
        print "Pay: ", final

computepay(45,10)
