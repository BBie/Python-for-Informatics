# Exercise 3.1 Rewrite your pay computation to give the employee 1.5 times the
# hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours.
# Enter Hours: 45
# Enter Rate: 10
# Pay: 475.0

Hours = int(raw_input('Hours: '))

Rate = 10
if Hours < 40:
	print Hours * Rate
elif Hours == 40:
	print Hours * Rate
elif Hours > 40:
	print 40 * Rate + (Hours - 40) * Rate * 1.5


## Exercise 3.2 Rewrite your pay program using try and except so that your program
## handles non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message and exiting the
## program. The following shows two executions of the program:

## Enter Hours: 20
## Enter Rate: nine
## Error, please enter numeric input
## Enter Hours: forty
## Error, please enter numeric input

try:
	H = float(raw_input('Enter Hours: '))
	R = float(raw_input('Enter Rate: '))

except:
	print 'Error, please enter numeric input'
